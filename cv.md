# Dmitry Bartoshevich

## About myself

I work as a marketing consultant and brand strategist.
Web development and related tasks are my hobby. My own site was made by myself. Also I made sites for several friends. I have some knowledge, but it is patchy and superficial. That's why I'm at RSS School.

All my sites are static. I use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as a site generator. When I complete RS School course, I'll move to [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and make the own site multilingual.

## Languages 

### English 
Level (B2/B1). 
About 5 years I worked for an international company where all work communication was in English. My English was about fluent. But it was 12 years ago. Since then I haven't used language actively. Mainly for reading. So I think the level of the language has dropped. 

### Polish 
Level A2. 

### Belarusian 
Native 

### Russian 
Fluently
